In the case of test failures, the failed drives will be passed to FA for analysis. Each failure has its own failure code and disposition to follow. With the current practice, FA technicians are required to scan the failed drives, extract the failure register, lookup the disposition accordingly and execute the task. This process can be time consuming and heavy especially during higher volume, which can affect the productivity. Scope: To study and understand the current practice and go through every single FA process to identify the ways to improve the process in the means of creating an automated disposition (web based). During the study, it is encouraged to highlight any other ideas or methods to improve the process. Supporting Team: Test Engineer Deliverable: Create web based automated failure disposition in FA Work collaboratively across sister sites Determine additional touch points for each process and provide recommendation for improvement Stretch goal: Contribute ideas on continuous improvement plans Requirement: Bachelor of any engineering background About Micron Technology, Inc.
